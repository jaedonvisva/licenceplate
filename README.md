# License Plate Reader Using OpenCV

This project implements a license plate detection and character recognition system using only OpenCV. The goal is to detect a license plate in an image or video, segment the characters, and recognize them using template matching techniques.

## Features
- Detect license plates from images or videos.
- Segment and extract individual characters from the detected license plate.
- Recognize characters using template matching (without external OCR libraries).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Imutils (for easy image manipulation)

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
